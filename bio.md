Story
===========

Chapter 1+2
-----------

Time it takes place:mid june,6497AD

the chapter starts as jem is getting close to the age of succession (20years old) and she is called into the throne room. her parents(mostly garnet) put a ultimatum that sh has to wed someone of royal blood by the end of the year or she is cut off. jem although irritated by other events that happened and this initially shrugs it off and continues on her normal schedule. the only thing her parents left for her to use, is the family sword(she still has and uses in her jab attack) and a shabby house still that is still in the royal courtyard. she then walks to school where she relearns how to use fireballs. when she leaves she is knocked unconsious and kidnapped.

she awakens in the royal lunar dungeon and soon after freeing herself from the cell she is in,frees prince flare lightbringer(his real name is cumulo) and as they are escaping she is attacked by bright signet.(flare's right hand man). after the fight jem spares bright under the condition that he only does kidnapping if her or flare commands it(this was done for flare's benefit and flare was rightfully angry with him after as that could of started a war. but the biggest part he was angry was he was kept out of the loop). flare drops jem off at eather, and after her ship was returned she started to do some research on him. ember noticed the research and got concerned and after learning of what happened she told jem's parents

garnet was livid that jem fell in love with a criminal, but pearlite remained cautious but was overriden by garnet a few times she tried to difuse the situation which majorly confused jem and obviously garnet mostly ignored it. garnet ignored this to an extent ha made another ultimatum that both jem and flare had to prove their love is genuine to his satisfaction or will put a execution order on both. jem then called flare over. and garnet started a few tests. after a test pearlite realized that these tests are dumb and is mostly testing jem rather than flare. bright put the whole world under siege and threatened to fire hyperion cannons at the planet if jem and flare are not released unharmed. soon after flare proposed and jem accepted. both garnet(under mind control of pearlite) and pearlite gave their blessing.

chapter 2 mostly takes place on earth and other than jem being attacked by corrupt solar council member not much to write about happened

Chapter 3
---------

chapter 3 takes place a few years later she had a daughter named crystal in witch crystal had an extreme amount of magic power. jem being the cautious one decided to find out how much magic power in a safe manner. flare took that as a way of saying to cut off crystal's magic power. so he taught crystal how to use magic dispite jem just telling him to wait. after some time passes flare looses track of crystal. jem decides to look for her and finds her in the basement of the intrepid flyer's hanger. crystal wanted to show jem the magic she was taught. dispite jem's protest to not do the spell, crystal did it anyways and severely hurt jem.(thankfully she survived and made a quick recovery) after a few months pass jem awakens from being knocked unconsious and called for a family meeting to update her on what has happened since. while she was unconsious she had a vision telling her to build a starship capable of exceding the speed of light. the after finding the book that had a curse(she used it as a blessing) that can reduce the amount of magic power crystal had(this was nearing low to mid nuclear weapon level). while flare did have reservations on using the spell he helped jem cast it. after this she starts the temporal knife project and tells billy(from another game) to rebuild the hanger.

Chapter 4+5
-----------

not much is allowed to be known from this point foward other than jem inadvertantly faked her death. her sister taking full control of eather, flare escaped to luna the only place that brier could never touch. he swapped crystal's first name and middle name which was light as a added means of protecting her from brier. meanwhile jem awoke in a unknown universe with knowledge of magic to allow her to travel the multiverse.
